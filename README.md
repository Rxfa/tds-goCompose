To setup our mongoDriver connection you must add an ".env" file 
and add an url in this format : 
MONGO_DB_CONN=mongodb+srv://{YourUsername}:{YourPassword}@{YourClusterInfo}.mongodb.net/{YourDBname}?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Make sure that your .env file is created in the source directory of this project.
